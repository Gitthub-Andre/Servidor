all about not even close what it's about

192
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,680
yes that's what determines whether you

193
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,160
pass or fail

194
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,720
but that's I mean I wanted to ask you

195
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,399
about that from the beginning

196
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,400
use your head three people on a squad

197
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,720
why do you think we would do that

198
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,160
[Music]

199
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,839
how are we supposed to know why you

200
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,639
picked three people we didn't make the

201
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:36,560
rules it's so basic teamwork

202
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,360
just working together is that what you

203
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,760
mean that's what I mean it's too late

204
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,600
now but if all three of you had come at

205
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:50,959
me you might have been able to take them

206
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,959
well anyway it's over wait a minute you

207
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,279
set it up with three people but only two

208
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,199
bells if we worked together and got the

209
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,800
bells only two of us could keep them and

210
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,240
that would lead to group conflict and

211
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:06,480
the squad would break up exactly i

212
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,639
purposely pitted you against each other

213
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,480
huh i wanted to see if you could

214
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,760
overcome that and put the squad ahead of

215
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,440
yourselves a genine should have a

216
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:21,120
natural feel for teamwork but you it

217
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,760
never even crossed your mind sakura you

218
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,440
obsessed about Sasuke who was gone while

219
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,680
Naruto was right in front of you when

220
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:32,160
you wouldn't lift a finger to help him

221
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,680
naruto you do everything on your own

222
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,079
everything

223
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,760
and you Sasuke thought the others were

224
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:41,199
so far beneath you they were worthless

225
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,839
arrogance ninja missions are carried out

226
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,920
in squads of course you need individual

227
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,240
skills but teamwork is the most

228
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,720
essential element every Shinobi

229
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,040
understands this when individuals put

230
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:58,000
themselves above the squad this can lead

231
00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:03,320
to failure and death for example Sakura

232
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,320
kill Naruto now or Sasuke dies

233
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,920
that's what happens on a mission

234
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,360
oh boy that was really scary

235
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,920
the enemy takes a hostage and you've got

236
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,839
an impossible choice and someone ends up

237
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,000
